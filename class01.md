# Class 01: HTML

## HTML: Chapter 1 - Structure
The Structure of HTML is written in elements. Each element generally has two tags:
  - Opening
  - Closing

  Examples:

      - Opening <html>
      - Closing: </html>

  Examples of element tags:

    - <body>
    - <title>
    - <header>

Within each element we can stylize them with something called an attribute. As how it is said attributes can range from colors, font types, languages, and much more.
  Some Examples of Attributes:

    - <body background-color="black">
    - <p text-align="center">
    - <h1 border-style="dotted">
 
  Background, text-align, and border-style would be considered your attribute names while what comes after the '=' sign is the attribute value.

Quote (John Duckett: HTML & CSS, 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana) - "Each new version was designed to be an approvement on the last." "There have also been several versions of each browser used to view web pages, each of which implements new code. Not all web users, however, have the latest brosers installed on their computers, which means that not everyone will be able to view all of the latest features and markup."
