#What did Google learn?

##This article outlines Rozovsky's and Project Aristotle's reasearchers comparison of teamwork.

Through her collegiate years at Yale University, she was in the throws of one group that would compete and fight over the limelight, while another group she was with for a competitive group was more relaxed. She didn't understand why her study group was always at ends with one another but if she caught them individually, they were more endearing and fun to communicate with. On the other hand, her case-competitive group, even with completely different backgrounds they connected easily. Brainstorming ideas with this group was smooth.

This set the tone in what Rozovsky decided to do with her life; study the habits of people. Upon graduation she was hired by Google and was assigned to Project Aristotle.
Project Aristotle was launched by Google to study their employees and figure out why some employees floundered as others excelled. Google spent millions to gather some of the best statisticians, psychologists, engineers etc.

At first these researchers couldn't find any specific correlation on what created a better team. Whether it was a balanced gender population, similar interests in hobbies, or educational backgrounds; there weren't any data points that they could tie together.

Rozovsky and her colleagues came across research that focused on "group norms." These group norms are kind of unwritten rules in which the entire group follows such as creating a specifiv environment that generates arguments, or to avoid arguments and encourages debates. These 'unwritten rules' became part of a team's culture. Thus, Project Aristotles researches came to the conclusion that understanding these norms would be the key to improving Google's team dynamics. Even while pinpointing these dynamics the success of each dynamic went in opposite directions.

These researchers started to dissect how each team member responded emotionally to an image of someone's eyes. They found that the higher the emotional intelligence of an individual and as a collective, the bonding towards one another and inclusivity of any one person was more cohesive than other groups. They found that no one wants to have to put on this 'professional hat' all the time while at the office. To me it leaves me feel as if I'm standing or sitting on pins and needles all of the time while on the clock. Everyone wants to feel "psychologically safe", where we can be free enough to be ourselves, not hide our personalities, or feel as if we can't have the most important conversations with the peers that we work with. The work environment can't just be all about the numbers, it can't be all about going from meeting to meeting, or continual calls and sending of emails.
